Hi, I'm m3hr. You might know me personally or online through twitter or IRC or something. I'm 18 and go to Columbia, and I'm from LA. This summer I was diagnosed with leukemia and I and others need hematopoietic stem cell transplants for a cure. You can read more about that [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation). Finding a match is especially hard for ethnic minorities and mixed-race people, because it's based on a protein marker that gets more varied as genetic diversity increases (or something, I don't understand it completely) but not blood type.

## What I'd love for you to do
Depending on which country you live in, you should *really*, *really* consider joining your country's bone marrow registry.

### How do I do that
There is a list of each member nation's registry on the [BMDW site](https://www.bmdw.org/index.php?id=addresses_members&no_cache=1). Each nation has its own process to join on their The member nation with the most donors registered is the U.S., which is where I am! Joining the U.S. registry is especially helpful to me, but any blood disorder patient around the world needs your help, if you can provide it. I'm also of Middle Eastern background (Iranian), so if you're of Middle Eastern or Mediterranean descent, we are possibly likelier to be a match. But I encourage everyone to join, for all patients who need help. Donating is a safe and painless process, and the chance of getting contacted to donate is 1 in 540.

https://join.bethematch.org/ <- This is the main process for donors in the U.S.

### What is the point of this repo
I was hoping that when people joined the registry, they provided some evidence so we can keep a list of all the kind people who joined, on GitHub.
The format for posting will be as follows
```
Preferred name
Date joined (in Mon DD, YYYY format)
Three-digit country code as seen on this list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3
URL of registry joined as found on this BMDW directory: http://www.bmdw.org/index.php?id=addresses_members&no_cache=1
```

An example:

```
Jane Doe

```

with a linebreak between each entry, all going into the REGISTERED.md file! 
### Why does this matter
Well, it saves lives, and leukemia is the most common form of pediatric cancer. Patients need your help, and I want to raise awareness. Many of us have the privileges of wealth, status, or health, and I think maybe as a society we should think more about issues like cancer, because we are getting close to cures for many of its forms, but the donations and donors need to keep flowing. A third (or more) of the population of a developed nation will get cancer in their lifetime. We patients need and are grateful for your help. (°w°)
